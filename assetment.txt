1. There is no file named as code.js, instead I found code1.js and code2.js
2. There are minor differences in the files in few functions.
3. In overdue function, the variable array which is used to store overdue task is different i.e. ovd to od 
   In dueToday function, the variable for storing todays task is different. i.e. tod to td 
   In dueLater function, the variable for stored tasks which are due later is changed i.e. led to ld.
4. Apart from that there are some spacing and linebreak differences.

From this, we can clearly see that this file is plagiarized.

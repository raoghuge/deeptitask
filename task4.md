# What is a stator (in short)?

The stationary electrical part of the motor. that contains a number of copper windings whose polarity is changed all the time when an alternating current (AC) or a direct current is applied is the stator.

The Copper windings act like an electromagnet whenever current passes through them

# What is a rotor in short?

The rotating part of the motor is known as the rotor.

There are various types of rotors depending on the motor type

BLDC or PMSM Motors have rotors consisting of permanent magnets that interact with the electro-magnetic field created by the stator windings in order to rotate.

Induction motors do not use magnets but use specially designed metal rotors (Squirrel cage) that work by induction caused by the stator coils. whenever there is current passing through the AC Induction Stator, it creates a magnetic field that in turn causes the metal rotors to rotate.

In DC brushed motors the stators and rotors are reversed, the stators in DC brushed motors contain the permanent magnets while the rotors contain the windings.

Now you might ask me how does the copper windings in a brushed DC motor get their electricity to create the magnetic field when it is constantly rotating?

The answer is with the help of **Commutators**.

## What is a commutator?

Simply put, the commutator is a component in a DC motor that turns the coils on and off to control which direction the electromagnetic fields are pointing. On one side of the coil, the electricity should always flow “away,” and on the other side, electricity should always flow “towards.” This ensures that the torque is always produced in the same direction. Otherwise, the coil would rotate 180 degrees one way, and then switch direction.
